Excel Guard duty
This repository aims to facilitate our understanding of the existing guard duty program and improve it further based on the given requirements.

## 2 requirements
1. Add random function (set probability around 4-5). 
   This is to ensure at least some guards are available for some days . 
   For example, there are 6 guards assigned on the 3rd Nov, while 0 guards are assigned 
   on 6th Nov. Do note that there are guards available for both days. A good solution would be to assign 3 guards for both days.
2. The stand-by guards need to have a point system similar to the Actual guards.


## Coding Style Guidelines
1. Use camelCase for variables, function and subroutine names, class modules.
